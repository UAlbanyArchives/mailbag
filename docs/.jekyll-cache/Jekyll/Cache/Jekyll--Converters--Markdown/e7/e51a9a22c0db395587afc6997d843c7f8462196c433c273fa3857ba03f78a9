I"ì<h1 id="windows-executables">Windows Executables</h1>

<p>Executables are available for Windows that contain all dependencies except the PDF dependencies. Download the latest <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mailbagit.exe</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mailbagit-gui.exe</code> files from the <a href="https://github.com/UAlbanyArchives/mailbag/releases">Github releases</a>.</p>

<p>These executables are unsigned, so Windows will likely give you as ‚ÄúWindows protected your PC‚Äù warning from Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. You will need sufficient permissions to allow unsigned executables on you machine.</p>

<p>Automatically converting the HTML within emails to PDFs can cause security vulnerabilities in some contexts. Since it is <a href="https://wkhtmltopdf.org/status.html">no longer actively maintained</a>, wkhtmltopdf does not recommend running it on user-supplied and unsanitized HTML.</p>

<p>Using Google Chrome may mitigate some, but not all of these concerns.</p>
