# Virtual Testing Day

The Mailbag Project team plans to hold multiple events where interested users can get together remotely and experiment using `mailbagit` with guidance from the project team.

We will walk though installing and using `mailbagit` and participants will then have an opportunity for hands-on use with processing email. Project Team members will also be available for questions and feedback.

Participants are encouraged to bring their own email data to use or experiment with provided datasets. 

## Register for the following dates:

[**May 27th, 2022 at 2pm-4pm Eastern Time**]()

[**June 8th, 2022 at 10am-12pm Eastern Time**]()
